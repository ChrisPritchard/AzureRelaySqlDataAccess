# AzureRelaySqlDataAccess
Uses a relay listener and a client library to forward database requests through an Azure Relay Hybrid Connection. Useful for accessing databases that are behind firewalls, for development purposes. E.g. building a site or app that needs access to the database, but where your development machine is outside the secure network.
